# Weather App

A basic Weather App made with Vanilla JS. The app uses fetch API to fetch the updated weather data and displays it to the user. The app infact has an exposed API key and I know exposing API keys is a serious vulnerability, but the key is a free public one and hence of little use to anyone. Building a backend for such a little project could be overkill and the project does just fine to demonstrate the use of fetch API with a free public key just as well.
